                Currently, all the payments are processed via Paypal or Bitcoin
                payment system. USD to BTC rate is fixed at the moment of
                invoicing. If during 1 day the Buyer does not pay the invoice,
                the amount can be recalculated (according to the USD to BTC rate
                then current). The Seller receives the payment according to the
                rate current at the moment of invoicing the Buyer (including
                fees) to his Bitcoin wallet. We are currently working on adding
                new payment methods. You can find out about new payment methods
                from our news.

                At InstaSell, we are connecting sellers and buyers. Some sellers
                prefer to keep the username confidential since they donâ€™t want

                like to avoid the possibility of an online transaction outside
